# Golf-Game-Master

# Introduction

Golf game developed using pygame in python.

* I made a mini golf game using pygame (one of the python module).
* The game has 9 levels .
* One can choose his ball from various balls that are there in the store. The currency used is the coins gained by the player from the gameplay.
* Each time the high score is recorded when ever a player makes one.
* There is power-meter in the lower left corner of the screen which shows the power with which the ball is hit.
* Before selecting power one has to give direction to the ball where he wants to hit it.
* After the shot the ball follows the physics laws without any wind resistance or any other resistance.
* If the ball falls in water , the water hazard is detected and a penalty is caused.
* At last all the scores are recorded in the sheet and compared with the par and the final score board is prepared.
* There are also three power-ups in the game:-
1. Power shot : power of the shot becomes 1.5x.
2. Sticky Power: The ball sticks to the place where it is hit (be it the wall).
3. Mulla gain: If the shot was not right then the chance will not be counted.
